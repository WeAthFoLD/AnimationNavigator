# AnimationNavigator 

A small utility for quickly navigating animation clips of current animation editing target.

Can be very very useful if you have object with hundreds of animation.

## Usage

Copy `Assets\Plugins` folder to your project.

Use `Ctrl+Shift+K` (`Cmd+Shift+K` for Mac) to open the navigator.

## Known Issues

* Currently doesn't support workflow of more than one animation window (will only use data on first window).
* Multiple clips of same name will not behave correctly (only one of them will be selected).
